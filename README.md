# Edge Matching → Jigsaw Puzzles → Polyomino Packing → Edge Matching Reduction Loop

A reduction loop connecting unsigned edge matching, signed edge matching,
jigsaw puzzles, and polyomino packing, from the paper
"**[Jigsaw Puzzles, Edge Matching, and Polyomino Packing: Connections and
Complexity](https://erikdemaine.org/papers/Jigsaw_GC/)**" by
Erik D. Demaine and Martin L. Demaine.

Given a 3-partition instance, this code constructs the corresponding edge
matching puzzle.  Then clicking the button reduces around the loop.
Warning: the full loop makes a very big puzzle, which can crash your browser.
